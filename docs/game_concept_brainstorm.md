# Game Brainstorming: "Sleep Tight" (Working Title)

## 1. Core Mechanics & Gameplay Loop
- **The "Sleep Meter"**: A visual indicator of how deeply the baby is sleeping. 
    - **Proximity Buzzing**: The closer the fly, the faster the meter drops.
    - **Landing**: If the fly lands on the baby (specifically the face), the meter drops drastically. >1 second = Game Over.
- **User Actions**:
    - **Shoo (Swipe)**: Safe way to move the fly away. Low point gain, but zero risk of waking the baby.
    - **Squash (Tap)**: High risk/High reward. Instant points and removes the fly. If you tap while the fly is on the baby, it's an instant "Wake Up" (Game Over).
- **Fly Behavior**:
    - **Regular Fly**: Predictable circular paths.
    - **Drunk Fly**: Erratic, sudden changes in direction.
    - **Mosquito**: Very quiet, stays in shadows, tries to "bite" (major sleep penalty).

## 2. Visuals & Atmosphere
- **Aesthetic**: **Stylized 3D (Pixar/Disney Style)**. 
    - *Rationale*: This provides a premium "Triple-A" feel without the "uncanny valley" of realism. It allows for highly expressive facial animations (baby pouting or smiling in sleep) and soft, vibrant lighting that feels "light and fun."
    - **Room Detail**: High-quality materials (soft fleece blankets, glowing nightlights, wooden crib) with a warm color palette.
- **Feedback**:
    - **Baby Stirring**: Visual cues like stretching, frowning, or small whimpers before waking up.
    - **Screen Effects**: Subtle vignettes or color shifts when the sleep meter is low.
- **Haptics**: Subtle vibrations for buzzing proximity; sharp "thud" for a successful squash.

## 3. Progression & Scoring
- **Time Score**: Points awarded for every second the baby stays asleep.
- **Combo System**: Squashing multiple flies in a row without "disturbing" the baby mid-air.
- **Upgrades (Future)**:
    - **White Noise Machine**: Passively slows sleep meter depletion.
    - **Soft Nightlight**: Makes mosquitoes easier to see.
    - **Electric Swatter**: Larger hit-box for squashing.

## 4. Production Value "Wow" Factors
- **Dynamic Lighting**: The room cycles through sunset, twilight, and moonlight.
- **ASMR Audio**: High-fidelity buzzing and soft breathing sounds.
- **Daily Challenges**: "The Afternoon Nap" (Bright, outside noises) vs "The Midnight Sleep" (Dark, many mosquitoes).
