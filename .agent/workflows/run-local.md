# Run Locally

// turbo-all

## Steps

1. Install dependencies (if not already done):
```powershell
npm install
```

2. Start the Vite dev server:
```powershell
npm run dev
```

3. Open the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

4. Use Chrome DevTools (F12) to enable mobile viewport (Ctrl+Shift+M) for the best experience.

## Notes
- The game uses a fixed 400x720 logical resolution and auto-scales to fit any screen
- Touch events work in mobile viewport emulation
- Mouse click = tap, mouse drag = swipe
